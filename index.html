                    <h1>Welcome to Balloon Popper!</h1>
                    <p>This exciting game features three challenging levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Your
                        objective is to pop balloons by clicking on them and earn points. However, be careful not to
                        click on
                        the red balloons,
                        as they will deduct points from your score.

                        In the Easy level, blue and red balloons will randomly appear on the screen. Each time you
                        successfully
                        pop a balloon
                        (excluding red balloons), your score will increase by 1. If your final score is greater than 6
                        out of
                        10, you will
                        advance to the next level. Otherwise, it's "Game Over!"

                        The Medium level introduces three types of balloons: blue, yellow, and red. Your goal remains
                        the
                        same—popping blue or
                        yellow balloons earns you 1 point, while popping a red balloon deducts 1 point. To progress to
                        the Hard
                        level, you must
                        achieve a minimum score of 6 out of 10. Falling short will result in "Game Over!"

                        The Hard level is the ultimate challenge. Here, four balloons—blue, green, yellow, and red—will
                        appear
                        randomly. Popping
                        a blue, green, or yellow balloon will increase your score by 1 point, while clicking on a red
                        balloon
                        will deduct 1
                        point. To emerge victorious and complete the game, you must score at least 6 out of 10.
                        Otherwise, it's
                        "Game Over!"

                        Good luck and have fun playing "Balloon Popper"!</p>
