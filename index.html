            <p>Welcome to "Balloon Popper"! This exciting game features three challenging levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Your
            objective is to pop balloons by clicking on them and earn points. However, be careful not to click on the red balloons,
            as they will deduct points from your score.
            
            In the Easy level, blue and red balloons will randomly appear on the screen. Each time you successfully pop a balloon
            (excluding red balloons), your score will increase by 1. If your final score is greater than 6 out of 10, you will
            advance to the next level. Otherwise, it's "Game Over!"
            
            The Medium level introduces three types of balloons: blue, yellow, and red. Your goal remains the same—popping blue or
            yellow balloons earns you 1 point, while popping a red balloon deducts 1 point. To progress to the Hard level, you must
            achieve a minimum score of 6 out of 10. Falling short will result in "Game Over!"
            
            The Hard level is the ultimate challenge. Here, four balloons—blue, green, yellow, and red—will appear randomly. Popping
            a blue, green, or yellow balloon will increase your score by 1 point, while clicking on a red balloon will deduct 1
            point. To emerge victorious and complete the game, you must score at least 6 out of 10. Otherwise, it's "Game Over!"
            
            Good luck and have fun playing "Balloon Popper"!</p>
